### About

**NOTE**: This is a fork of https://github.com/JesusFreke/smali for patches needed by Google as the original repository is currently not maintained.

smali/baksmali is an assembler/disassembler for the dex format used by dalvik, Android's Java VM implementation. The syntax is loosely based on Jasmin's/dedexer's syntax, and supports the full functionality of the dex format (annotations, debug info, line info, etc.)
